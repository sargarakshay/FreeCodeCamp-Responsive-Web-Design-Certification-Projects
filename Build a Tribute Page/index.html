        <p id="tribute-info">When Cappy died in 1931, Cathy decided to stay on. By then she had a new neighbour: the Yaqui Valley Experiment Station, a grand agricultural research centre with impressive stone pillars, and cleverly designed irrigation canals.<br><br> For a
            while, the centre raised cattle, sheep and pigs, and grew oranges, figs and grapefruit.<br><br> But by 1945, the fields were overgrown, the fences fallen and the windows shattered. The station was infested with rats.<br><br> So when Cathy
            heard strange rumours about a young American man setting up camp in this dilapidated place - despite the lack of electricity, sanitation, or running water - she drove over to investigate.<br><br> There she found the Rockefeller Foundation's
            Norman E Borlaug, who was trying to breed wheat which could resist stem rust, a disease that ruined many crops.<br><br></p>
